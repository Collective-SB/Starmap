### Installing

2. Clone the repo using the command `git clone https://github.com/Collective-SB/Starmap`
3. Install repo
   a) In the new directory (called Starmap) run the command `npm i`
   b) Create a new file called `.env` (in the same directory). Copy this into that file and save: `PORT=80`
   c) Create a new file called `env.js`, place this file in the `public\js` folder. The content of the file should be:

```js
export const ENV_FROM_ENVJS = "remoteDev";
export const AUTH_REDIR_FROM_ENVJS = "local";
```

4. Start the server by running `node index.js`
5. Test that it is working. In your browser if you go to http:\\localhost\ you should see Starmap
